## How to Use

- Start with **example.md** to understand a sample baseline setup.  
- Follow **deployment.md** for automating infrastructure provisioning and updates.  
- Use **monitoring.md** to implement reliable system health checks and alerts.  
- Consult **scaling.md** to plan and execute resource scaling effectively.

## Notes

- Infrastructure documentation aims to make environment setup and maintenance repeatable and less error-prone.  
- Keep the docs up to date to reflect real-world infrastructure changes.  
- Use version control for all IaC (Infrastructure as Code) files.
