    Purpose:
    This document provides a detailed outline of estimation techniques used for cost, effort, and time in the project. 
    Based on principles from Software Project Management by Bob Hughes et al.

    Update Frequency:
    Whenever a major estimation is performed or recalibrated during planning or re-planning phases.

# üßÆ Project Estimation

## üìù Overview

This file describes how the team estimates effort, cost, and time for features and milestones. 
It includes techniques used, assumptions made, and records of past estimations.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Maintain a consistent estimation methodology  
- Increase accuracy through historical learning  
- Clarify assumptions and variables used  

---

## üîß Estimation Techniques

| Technique              | Description                                       | Use Case             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Expert Judgment        | Based on team‚Äôs domain expertise                  | Feature complexity   |
| Function Point Analysis| Measures functionality from the user‚Äôs view      | Business applications|
| Analogy-based Estimation | Compares with previous similar projects         | Reusable modules     |
| Delphi Method          | Consensus through multiple expert rounds         | High-risk components |
| COCOMO II              | Cost model estimating person-months               | Large-scale planning |

---

## üßæ Assumptions

- Team velocity remains consistent after sprint 2  
- External dependencies deliver on agreed timelines  
- Infrastructure setup will not exceed 2 weeks

## Time Breakdown Table

Module-wise or task-wise breakdown (include diagrams or Gantt chart if needed).

## Effort Estimate

In person-hours or person-months. Mention the allocation of devs, testers, PMs.


| Feature/Module         | Estimated Effort (hrs) | Actual Effort (hrs) | Variance |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Auth System            | 40                     | 48                   | +8       |
| API Gateway            | 50                     | 44                   | -6       |
| DB Schema Design       | 35                     | 32                   | -3       |

---

## Cost Estimate

Use effort √ó hourly/daily rate. Include hardware, cloud, licenses, and hidden costs.

| Module/Phase        | Est. Cost (\$) | Actual Cost (\$) | Variance (\$) | Justification                  |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Backend Development | 1200           | 1300             | +100          | Extra effort due to DB rewrite |
| UI/UX Design        | 800            | 800              | 0             | Within planned hours           |
| Testing & QA        | 600            | 500              | -100          | Automated test reuse           |
| DevOps Setup        | 1000           | 1100             | +100          | Unexpected infra change        |

## Buffer Allocation Table

Add a % for unknowns, e.g., "15% contingency".

| Phase/Task           | Base Estimate (hrs) | Buffer % | Buffer Time (hrs) | Final Allocated Time (hrs) |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Core Feature Dev     | 80                  | 20%      | 16                | 96                         |

## üìå Notes

- Round all time to the nearest 2 hours for planning simplicity  
- Use confidence intervals (best, worst, most likely) for risky components
