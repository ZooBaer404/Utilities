# 📋 Monitoring & Control Strategy

Defines how the project progress will be **observed**, **measured**, and **course-corrected** when needed.

---

## 🧭 Objectives

- Detect deviations from the plan early.
- Provide data for decision-making.
- Ensure accountability.
- Enable risk-based intervention.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric               | Target Value     | Tool/Source                | Update Frequency |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Feature Completion % | 100% by deadline | Issue Tracker (e.g., Jira) | Weekly           |
| Bug Fix Rate         | ≥ 90%            | QA Reports                 | Per Sprint       |
| Deployment Frequency | ≥ 1/week         | CI/CD Logs                 | Weekly           |
| Build Success Rate   | ≥ 95%            | CI Pipeline                | Daily            |

---

## 🧠 Escalation Criteria

If any of the following occur, the issue must be **escalated immediately**:

- 🟥 KPIs drop below 70% for 2 consecutive sprints.
- 🚨 Security vulnerabilities with CVSS score ≥ 8.
- ⚠️ Budget overrun projected > 20%.
- 🧯 Stakeholder dissatisfaction flagged twice in feedback.

| 2. Impact Analysis        | Project Manager evaluates cost, time, risk                 |
| 3. Approval/Denial        | Decision by PM or Steering Committee (if major)            |
| 4. Communication          | All stakeholders notified via `meetings.md` or update memo |
