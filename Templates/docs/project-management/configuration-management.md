START OF configuration-management.md

Purpose:
Define the process and responsibilities for managing changes to configuration items (code, docs, environments, libraries, etc.) to maintain system integrity and traceability.

Update Frequency:
At project start, before major release cycles, or after significant tech/process shifts.

# 🧰 Configuration Management Plan

Outlines how all project artifacts (code, infra, docs, tools) are versioned, tracked, audited, and restored.  
Because “it worked on my machine” is *not* a recovery strategy. 😅

---

## 🔑 Objectives

- Maintain integrity and traceability of configuration items (CIs)
- Prevent unauthorized changes
- Enable rollback and change audits
- Support stable build and deployment processes

---

## 🧱 Configuration Items (CIs)

| CI Type         | Description                      | Tool/Storage Location          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Source Code     | All codebases                    | GitHub / GitLab                |
| Documentation   | Project docs & user manuals      | Markdown in `/docs/`           |
| Dependencies    | Package & lib versions           | `package.json`, `go.mod`, etc  |
| Build Artifacts | Compiled binaries, Docker images | CI/CD, Docker Hub, Artifactory |
| Infrastructure  | IaC templates, env configs       | Terraform, YAML, .env files    |
| Config Files    | System and app configuration     | `.env`, `.conf`, YAML          |

---

## 🧬 Version Control

| Aspect            | Practice                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| VCS Tool          | Git (GitHub/GitLab)                    |
| Branching Model   | Trunk-based / Git Flow / Hybrid        |
| Commit Convention | Conventional Commits (feat, fix, etc.) |
| Tagging Releases  | Semantic Versioning (e.g., v1.0.0)     |
| Merge Strategy    | PR + code review                       |

---

## 🔄 Change Control Process

All CIs must follow this lifecycle:

| Stage          | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Identification | Add new CI to registry and tag initial version        |
| Proposal       | Raise PR or issue with rationale, reviewer assignment |
| Review         | Peer-reviewed, tested, and approved                   |
| Implementation | Merged and deployed to appropriate environment        |
| Tracking       | Linked to commit, issue, or release note              |

---

## 🧑‍🔧 Roles & Responsibilities

| Role           | Responsibility                             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Config Manager | Owns this plan, updates CI registry        |
| Developers     | Follow standards, update items via PR      |
| QA Team        | Validate changes don’t break dependencies  |
| DevOps / SRE   | Monitor config drift, enforce infra parity |

---

## 🧾 Change Log (History of Configuration Changes)

| Date       | Item Changed         | Changed By | Summary                           | Related Issue |
|------------|----------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| 2025-05-16 | `.env.prod`          | DevOps     | Updated DB connection params      | #DB-221       |
| 2025-05-18 | `main.go`            | Backend    | Switched auth method to JWT       | #AUTH-332     |
| 2025-05-21 | `docker-compose.yml` | DevOps     | Added Redis + rate limiter config | #OPS-119      |

---

## 🧯 Rollback Strategy

- Every merged change should be tagged or checkpointed.
- Critical config files tracked in Git or encrypted vault.
- Use Docker image tagging and Git commits for rollback.
- Infra-as-code changes require state backups and plan diffs.

---

## 🧪 Validation

| CI Type      | Validation Type               | Frequency  |
|--------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| Code         | Unit & Integration Tests      | Per Commit |
| Infra        | Terraform Plan, Previews      | On PR      |
| Config Files | Linting + Manual Verification | On Update  |

---

## 📒 Historical Configuration Reviews

| Date       | Reviewed By | Key Finding                   | Action Taken            |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 2025-05-10 | PM + DevOps | Env mismatch in staging/prod  | Synced and documented   |
