# ✅ Quality Management Plan

This document ensures the **product** meets the defined **quality standards**, and that **processes** are consistently improved to reduce defects and increase reliability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Define clear quality goals and acceptance criteria  
- Standardize review and testing practices  
- Promote defect prevention over defect detection  
- Ensure traceability from requirements to tests
