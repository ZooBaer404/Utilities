# 🧰 Resource Management Plan

This file documents how **people**, **tools**, and **time** will be allocated effectively — ensuring no one is overworked, underused, or somehow debugging in a production server at 2am 😅

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify and assign key resources for each major task
- Ensure fair distribution of workload
- Avoid resource contention and burnout
- Track and optimize utilization over time

## 🛠 Resource Contingency Plan

> If someone gets sick, goes rogue, or a server explodes, here’s how we bounce back.

- Maintain at least **1 backup** per key resource
- Cross-train Devs and QA in minimal tasks
- Pre-allocate **buffer time** in critical sprints
- Maintain a pool of **freelancers** or interns (if budget allows)
