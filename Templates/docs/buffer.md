## ⏳ Types of Buffers

- **Project Buffer:** Overall contingency for the project.
- **Feeding Buffers:** Buffers on critical paths feeding into the main timeline.
- **Resource Buffers:** Extra availability of critical resources.

## 🔄 Buffer Usage Tracking

Track buffer consumption regularly and escalate if buffer usage exceeds thresholds.

| Date       | Buffer Type     | Amount Used | Remaining | Actions Taken          |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| 2025-05-20 | Project Buffer  | 3 days      | 7 days    | Adjusted timeline     |
| 2025-05-21 | Resource Buffer | 5%          | 10%       | Allocated more hires  |
