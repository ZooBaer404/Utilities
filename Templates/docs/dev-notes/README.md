## How to Use

- Start with **[tools-setup.md](tools-setup.md)** to prepare your environment.
- Refer to **[general-tips.md](general-tips.md)** and **[code-snippets.md](code-snippets.md)** daily to keep your code clean and efficient.
- Dive into **[architecture-insights.md](architecture-insights.md)** if you want to understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind major design choices.
- Use **[performance.md](performance.md)** for optimization guidance and profiling notes.
- Check **[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)** whenever you hit a snag.
- Take **[anti-patterns.md](anti-patterns.md)** seriously as it may damage the codebase if not.
- Illustrate **[data-flow.md](data-flow.md)** to show how what happens to the data.
- Update **[cache-strategy.md](cache-strategy.md)** once in a while to squeeze every bit of performance out of the program.
