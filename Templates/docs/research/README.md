# ðŸ”¬ Research

This directory contains detailed investigations, background reading, comparisons, and prototypes that help us make informed decisions before committing to tools, designs, or methodologies.

## Purpose

To avoid assumptions and dumb decisions, this is where we:

- Evaluate frameworks, libraries, or stacks
- Compare performance or trade-offs
- Analyze past failures (our own or othersâ€™)
- Document PoCs (Proof of Concepts) and experiment results

## Folder Structure

docs/research/
â”œâ”€â”€ databases/ # e.g., SQL vs NoSQL comparisons
â”œâ”€â”€ performance/ # Load testing, benchmarks, memory analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ tools-evaluation/ # IDEs, CI/CD, testing tools, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ design-alternatives/ # Explorations of different architectural patterns
â””â”€â”€ findings.md # Summary of key insights and recommendations

## Update Frequency

> ðŸ“š Update as soon as new research is done or old findings are revisited.

> ðŸ§  Bonus tip: Add a summary section at the top of each research doc for lazy readers (like future you).
